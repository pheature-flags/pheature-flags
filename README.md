<h1>Pheature Flags</h1>
</div>

Hi there! Welcome to our project 👋 We are a group of online business professionals who want to learn, grow and enjoy
making our jobs a better place. We’re excited that you’re here to learn more about it and grow together 😉 .

> 🚧 We are at early development stage, every contribution of every type will be welcome and properly attributed.

Pheature Flags is a release management system that allows to activate and deactivate specific features in controlled conditions:

**Key Features**

* Rollback any part of the code when it is not working as expected.
* Target specific audiences with dynamic versions of a product to get real insights
* Enable/disable AB testing.
* Start/pause pre-set marketing campaigns.
* Develop rollout strategies.
* Decrease the technical debt on applying complex business experiments.

Our main goal is to build trusted relationships between developers and stakeholders around the software release process.
